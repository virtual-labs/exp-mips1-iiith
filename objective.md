The following are the objectives of this series of assignments.

1. Introduce the Structure of an Assembly Language Program: Data and Text Sections.

2. Introduce Assembly Directives to allocate memory in the Data Section.

3. Introduce the idea that MIPS is a Load-Store Architecture and data has to be moved to registers before any operations can be performed on them.

4. Difference between Signed and Unsigned Arithmetic.

5. What if there are program constants whose size is greater than 16 bits?
6. How to convert a complex expression into an Assembly Program evaluating that expression?
